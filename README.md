# Project Specifications

## Layout

1. **Overall Layout**. App contains 4 - 10 questions, including at least one check box, one radio button, and one text entry.
2. **Question types**. Questions are in a variety of formats such as free text response, checkboxes, and radio buttons.
Checkboxes are only used for questions with multiple right answers. Radio buttons are only used for questions with a single right answer.
3. **Submit button**. App includes a button for the user to submit their answers and receive a score.
4. **View variety**. The app includes at least four of the following Views: TextView, ImageView, Button, Checkbox, EditText, LinearLayout, RelativeLayout, ScrollView, RadioButton, RadioGroup.
If applicable, the app uses nested ViewGroups to reduce the complexity of the layout.
5. **Rotation**. The app gracefully handles displaying all the content on screen when rotated. Either by updating the layout, adding a scrollable feature or some other mechanism that adheres to Android development guidelines.
6. **Grading Logic**. The grading logic checks each answer correctly. The app accurately calculates the number of correct answers and does not include incorrect answers in the count.
Note: When applicable, in the grading logic remember to check that the correct answers are checked AND the incorrect answers are not checked.
7. **Best practices**. The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
   * Text sizes are defined in sp.
   * Lengths are defined in dp.
   * Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.

The goal was to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certian topics. I have chosen Java as the topic.
This app contains 10 quiz questions. The questions may ask to choose one answer from a group of radio buttons, multiple answers from a group of check boxes, or type in an answer.
